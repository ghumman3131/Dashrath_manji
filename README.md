# Dashrath_manji

In this Project we demonstrate how to make side navigation using Drawer Layout.

To make side navigation we first make one root drawerlayout of width and height match_parent and inside this layout we make two 
layouts both having width and height match_parent. In one layout we design our main layout design and in another layout we make design of 
sidebar. And finally we give layout_gravity="left or right" to hide our sidebar by default and it only open on swipping.
